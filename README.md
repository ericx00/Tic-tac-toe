HOW TO PLAY

 The goal is to get three of your symbols (either “X” or “O”) in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
 Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty cell.
“X” goes first.
Alternately, players place their symbol until the board is full or someone wins.
Winning Conditions:
A player wins if they have three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
If the entire board is filled without a winner, the game is a draw.
